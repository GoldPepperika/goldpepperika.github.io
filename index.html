        <h1>Hi. Welcome to this site.</h1>
        <p>So, I made this because I didn't want to upload my art to art sites but I just realised that I've just forgotten about this site multiple times. 
            Even when I did draw, it wasn't good art but I would still put it up. I'm gonna work on my art skills to make the drawings more "presentable" 
            and "less shit" then I will start using site again. I'm just holding on to this "domain". I was also gonna start putting music on this site to 
            but I just realised I need to work on music stuff before just posting whatever. And also I'm probably just gonna post it on something like 
            Bandcamp. I plan to use this site as a sort of "Ground Zero" or "Hub" for my stuff. If you somehow found this site, then I hope you're doing 
            well and I hope you're safe and healthy. :)
        </p>
        <p>Kind regards and love,</p>

        <p>P.S. I know typing all this may be stupid but I don't care!</p>
